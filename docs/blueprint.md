## Style Guidelines:

- Dark Theme: Deep slate blue background (#0f172a), white primary text, semi-transparent white secondary text, and a vibrant amber/gold (#f59e0b) accent.
- Light Theme: Off-white background (#f8fafc), dark slate text, and the same amber accent (#f59e0b).
- UI/English Text: 'Inter', a clean, modern sans-serif font.
- Quranic/Arabic Text: 'Amiri', a traditional, elegant serif font.
- Apply glassmorphism: Use frosted glass effect for all primary UI containers (cards, navigation bars, modals): semi-transparent background, prominent background blur, and a subtle, light border.
- Maintain generous padding and spacing for a breathable, uncluttered feel. Significantly rounded corners (16px to 24px radius) for all cards and interactive elements.
- Implement smooth and subtle animations. New pages/views gently fade in and slide up from the bottom. Buttons and cards have a gentle 'scale' effect on press.
